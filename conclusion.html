<h2>Our Idea and Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The many sources that we looked at had differing views on the benefits or cons of foreign intervention. While some agreed that foreign intervention was beneficial to those that intervened, and that it could make situations better for those that are being helped, others concluded that it could actually harm those being ‘helped’ and could make the situation worse. Despite this, we can still conclude that the prospect of foreign intervention is still ethical and favorable.
</p>
<p>
The next question to ask is how do we execute it? We obviously don't want to cause a situation where more people are harmed than benefited, so what is the plan? If we were to ask Peter Singer, he would probably say effective altruism. Effective Altruism asks us to find the most effective way to solve a problem, be it if the problem were right next to us or halfway across the world. Considering foreign intervention is essentially that, then the answer to “How do we execute foreign intervention?” is the idea of foreign intervention. We have to examine the situation before engaging, determine the best course of action by deciding how it would be the most efficient, and then help those that need it by intervening.
