# Great-Ideas-Culminating-Project
This website and its content was made by River Creech and Larry Migl,sophomores at LASA High School at the time of this website's creation. This was made as the final product of our Culminating Project in Great Ideas. We chose the topic "foreign intervention" because it took topics of both ideas we were interested in researching and connecting them with ideas from AP World History.
