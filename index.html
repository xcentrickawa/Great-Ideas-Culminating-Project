		<h2>Introduction to the Question</h2>
		<p>
		Ethical choices and the most efficient way to help people was a major part of our class. There was one ethical dilemma we thought up that held a very strong basis in ethics. This dilemma being foreign intervention. Foreign intervention is a country stepping into another country that is facing some sort of dilemma, like a war or disease. We wondered if it would be ethical to intervene in the first place, and if so, how should we even intervene. So, we asked ourselves, should foreign intervention be allowed? Why or why not? If so, how should it be executed?
		</p>
		<h2>What Exctly is Foreign Intervention?</h2>
		<p>
			Wikipedia's definition is "governmental interference in economic affairs at home or in political affairs of another country."
			<br>
			Throughout our writing, we expand on this defintion, and include governmental interference in another country's affairs in general.

		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>
			This website and its content was made by River Creech and Larry Migl, sophomores at LASA High School at the time of this website's creation. This was made as the final product of our Culminating Project in Great Ideas. We chose the topic "foreign intervention" because it took topics of both ideas we were interested in researching and connecting them with ideas from AP World History.
